This project uses Python to analyze student stress factors and build a machine learning model to predict stress levels. It helps understand student well-being and potentially identify at-risk students.

Introduction:

Students today face a constant barrage of pressures, both academic and personal, leading to significant stress. This stress can affect their mental and physical health, academic performance, and overall well-being. Research shows a clear link between stress and student outcomes, with stressed students experiencing increased anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and even substance abuse.

Identifying the root cause of student stress is crucial. While academic pressures like exams and deadlines are common culprits, personal challenges like financial worries, social anxieties, and relationship issues can also play a significant role. The complex interplay between these factors makes pinpointing the cause of stress in individual students a difficult task.

This study aims to leverage the power of data analysis to shed light on student stress. By using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we can uncover patterns and connections within student data that might be linked to stress levels. These insights can help us understand the "why" behind student stress, allowing us to address the root causes.

Furthermore, this research will explore the development of a predictive model. This model, trained on the analyzed data, could potentially predict when students are at risk of experiencing high stress levels. This ability to predict stress would be invaluable in creating targeted interventions and support systems to proactively address student well-being and promote academic success.

Problem Statement:

Students today face a multitude of pressures, both academic and personal, that contribute to significant stress levels. This stress can negatively impact their mental and physical health, academic performance, and overall well-being. However, our current understanding of the specific factors contributing most to individual student stress remains limited. Additionally, proactively identifying students at risk is challenging, often relying on self-reported stress. 

About Dataset:
